# Questions and Answer Message Board

## By Benjamin T. Seaver

## Epicodus JavaScript Week 2 Code Review featuring Ember.

Create a question and answer message board where a user submits a question and other users can respond with answers.

* Questions should have the content of the question itself, an author and additional notes.
* Answers should have the content of the answer and the author.
* Include a header and/or navbar that appears on all pages containing the name of your site and a link to the home page.
* List all questions on the homepage, with only the question and the name of the author showing.
* Users should be able to click on a question, and be routed to another page containing additional information.
* Allow users to add and edit questions.
* Allow users to add answers to a question. Answers should be added and viewed on the same page as the question they respond to.

* Objectives - Your code will be reviewed for the following objectives:
  * Application template contains header with link(s).
  * Data is stored in and retrieved from Ember Data models and Firebase.
  * Components are used to create display and behavior for your templates.
  * One-to-many relationship exists between Question and Answers.
  * Application works as expected.
  * Project is in a presentable, portfolio-quality state.
  * Required functionality is in place by Friday deadline.
  * Code and Git documentation follow best practices, including a planning section in your readme as described in this weeks documentation lesson.
  * Project demonstrates understanding of week's concepts. If prompted, you are able to discuss your code with an instructor using correct terminology.

* Further Exploration - If you have completed the objectives for the code review, consider adding some additional features:
  * Add custom styling.
  * Implement upvote/downvote functionality so that users may vote on answers.
Add tags to questions.
